<h1>becto-fli4l: git-skeleton for fli4l-4</h1>

<p>The last testing version of fli4l was released in 2022/10/14 &rarr; the read-only svn repository is currently still online &rarr; so here is a part of the original svn repository as a skeleton on github.</p>
<p>The skeleton helps you to create a fli4l installation folder from the latest svn revision (<strong>r60808</strong>) and is also a template for further development of the software on your own computer.</p>
<p>Since fli4l is designed as a router or firewall, essential components should only be downloaded from secure sources. For this reason, the skeleton only consists of the absolute minimum.</p>
<p>If the read-only svn server of fli4l fails, the software can still be further developed on your own (intel-based) computer at your own risk.</p>

<p>How to use the skeleton:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Clone the github repository <strong>becto-fli4l</strong> to get the skeleton</p></li>
  <li><p>Use a svn checkout to load the precompiled binaries from the fli4l svn-repo <strong>https://repo.nettworks.org/svn/fli4l</strong> &rarr; a shell script is included in the skeleton </br>&rarr; ./_svn-repo.nettworks.org~bin.sh &crarr; </p></li>
  <li><p><u>Optional:</u></p></li>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Use a svn checkout to load the original packages directory from the fli4l svn-repo <strong>https://repo.nettworks.org/svn/fli4l</strong> &rarr; a shell script is included in the skeleton </br>&rarr; ./_svn-repo.nettworks.org~packages.sh &crarr;</p></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Then you can move the packages you need into the package directory under /src/packages</p></li>
    </ul>
  <li><p>Execute the shell script &rarr; <strong>./_mkfli4lgit.sh</strong> &crarr; in the src folder &rarr; done</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that the skeleton is still new and various fli4l packages and functions are still missing, e.g. precompiled latex docs.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use the skeleton, you can also use the <strong>*tar.gz</strong> archives from &rarr; <strong>Harvey</strong>, which can be found on his cloud storage at gmx and can be unpacked directly into a fli4l installation folder / Harvey is part of the fli4l development team.</p>
<p>If you have further questions or if you need help customising the skeleton, you are welcome to create an issue on github or post on news:spline.fli4l.dev.</p>
